# Binary tree

## What?

Simple implementation of binary tree Class.

## Why?

I wanted to create a clean implementation of Binary Tree using Javascript.

## What it can do?

This implementation supports:

`add` - adding items

`remove` - deleting items

`find` - searching

`contains` - checking if element exists

`traverse` - going through the tree with callback

`size` - checking count of nodes

`toArray` - converting to array

`toString` - converting to string

## Starting

`npm i`

## Memory usage

For data sets like numbers, strings, objects, binary tree size in memory grows 20-50%.

The usage was significantly optimized in v0.2.0 (125-200%).

## Unit tests

Run `npm test` for single test, or `npm run test-w` with watch.
