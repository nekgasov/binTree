#What?

Simple implementation of binary tree Class.

#why?

I didn't find a solid solution for binary tree over the internet. 

This implementation does support:

`add` - adding items

`remove` - deleting items

`find` - searching

`contains` - checking if element exists

`traverse` - going through the tree with callback

`size` - checking count of nodes

`toArray` - converting to array

`toString` - converting to string

#Strating

`npm i`

#Unit testing

Run `npm test` for single test, or `npm run test-w` with watch.
